Learned about Document Object Model queries

getElementById -> this query would only return that one specific element since ID's in particular can only be used once per HTML element.

<!-- note to self: queries with getElements would normally return us an array of our HTML elements. -->

getElementsByClassName -> this query would return an array of elements with the same class name.

getElementsByTagName -> this query would return an array of elements with the indicated HTML tag.

.querySelector -> this would return us the first element/html tag that it comes across our HTML file. Unless specified in its argument/parameter, this would return us a much more precise element/tag with either the ID or class name.
